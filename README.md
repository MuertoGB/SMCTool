**SMC Tool by David R:**
-
Aimed at Mac logic board technicians, SMCTool makes flashing a replacement SMC quicker and easier. It not only saves time, but money, as a specific donor SMC isn't necessary to have 'on hand'. Simply take a matching donor SMC* from another board, replace and flash.

*Currently, a full list of SMC boot compatibility between boards has not been established. I recommend you keep the board years as close as possible when taking a donor SMC from a non-matching board, otherwise the machine may not power on.

It has come to my attention SMCTool may not like some USB memory sticks, I use SanDisk SDCZ50 USB 2.0 without issue. Possibly an issue with UEFI, I don't know, yet. Also, removing the system storage drive is necessary in most cases, otherwise 'startup.nsh' may not run.

üí° This project is based on the work from  [logi.wiki](https://logi.wiki/index.php?title=SMC_flashing).\

**Before you start:**
-
I'm not responsible if you do something wrong, if you're here I expect you to know what you're doing. Where I do my utmost to verify all information to my best ability, I'm also not responsible for any mistakes my end either. As they say, sometimes shit happens.

This is also **not** a magical 'fix my Mac' tool, it has a specific purpose, which is flashing correct payloads to a System Management Controller with incorrect firmware.

---
**Download:**
-
Current Version: `1.0.7` - (16th February, 2023)\
See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\
Downloads can be acquired in the [releases](https://github.com/MuertoGB/SMCTool/releases) section.

---
**Creating a USB disk:**
-
To begin, format a USB disk in ExFAT, FAT32, VFAT or HFS+ using a GPT or MBR partition table, then....

- Option A: Manually copy all SMC_Tool.iso files to the formatted USB disk.
- Option B: Write the SMC_Tool.img to disk with ddrescue, Passmark imageUSB, or similar.
- Option C: Use a bootable USB creation tool and select SMC_Tool.iso as the source file.

Extended instructions [here](BOOTABLEUSB.md).

---
**Flashing the SMC:**
-
  1. Plug in your USB disk and power on the Mac whilst holding the `Option ‚å•` key.
  2. Load into `SMC Tool` from the boot menu and let startup.nsh run.
  3. Type the boardnumber.nsh you want to flash, e.g: `820-00165.nsh`, then press return, the script will then flash the SMC.
  4. Type 'exit' to reboot, or power off machine to complete the process.

  Quick video of flashing an SMC [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUm30m3zNxI).

---
**Compatible Boards:**
-
See the [compatibility information](COMPATIBILITY.md).

Older, single file payloads for boards such as 820-3115/3332 are currently being worked out. Support may be added in the future.

---

**Compatible SMC:**
-

‚úÖ Texus Instruments LM4 BGA157\
‚ùå Texus Instruments TM4 BGA168\
‚ùå Renesas DF2117 BGA145

Currently supporting MacBook, and Mac Mini. iMac support is in development.

**Why must the firmware be flashed:**
-
Each System Management Controller is specifically programmed for it's counterpart board, and is in charge of managing video, hibernation, battery charging, thermal and power management. Incorrect or mismatched firmware causes erratic behaviour such as broken display resolution, high fan speed, throttling, and crashing.

---
**If you flash the wrong firmware:**
-
You must immediately flash the correct firmware before powering off the system. In some cases you **might** brick the system if you reboot after flashing the incorrect firmware. After much testing I've never achieved a bricked board by flashing an incorrect firmware, however, others have mentioned 'no power' after loading the wrong SMC firmware for that board after a reboot, or power down.

If a system is somehow rendered 'bricked' and cannot get to the boot menu, you must replace the SMC again. You can always put the incorrectly flashed SMC aside for future use on a board it was 'accidentally' programmed for.

---
**If you want to flash a different firmware:**
-
You must replace the update, base, code and EPM in the respective folder, say 820-00165 would be `payloads\Mac-937CB26E2E02BB01`.

Alternative SMC payloads can be found in firmwareupdate.pkg inside the MacOS Install.ESD file, or [here](https://github.com/sadponyguerillaboy/SMC-Toolkit/tree/main/SMCPayloads).

---

**Screen resolution:**
-
Use the `mode` command to display a list of supported screen modes, type the highest mode available e.g. `mode 160 47`, then press return.

The script will automatically switch screen mode when it can.

  *** UEFI Shell v2.0, release 4.632 ***

  This bootable image contains builds of the 2.0 UEFI Shell, as provided by the
  Open Source 'EDK' project (https://github.com/tianocore/edk).

  More specifically, this release, which we call '4.632', was produced using the
  Shell executables, built on 2010.05.07, and published at:
  https://github.com/tianocore/edk/tree/master/Other/Maintained/Application/UefiShell/bin

  This image supports the following UEFI platform architectures:
  * X64
  * IA32

  You are invited to validate that the binaries provided on this ISO are 100%
  identical to the ones from the official EDK project.

  For more information on this release, you are invited to visit our official
  project page at https://github.com/pbatard/UEFI-Shell.
